# MCNP-Simulated HPGe Soil Spectra

A public release of **6,000 MCNP-simulated HPGe gamma-ray spectra** for **41** common soil radionuclides, designed to accelerate machine-learning research in isotope identification and quantification.

## üìÑ Manuscript

A manuscript describing this dataset and benchmarking results is currently **under preparation** for submission. A preprint will be made available here upon acceptance, or contact the authors at [haipn91@ioit.ai.vn] for a draft.

## üìÇ Dataset

Due to GitHub file size limits, the large spectral files are hosted externally.  
All dataset components are freely available under a **CC BY 4.0** license:

- [**Spectra.csv**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pwHIeBFBW0vxcsvZKDMRbV3zPk6LtDF1/view?usp=sharing)  
  - Full set of 6,000 spectra (each row is an 8192-channel vector).

- [**hpge-soil-gamma-41.npz**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16Bxfsa7TMqq65eRUCAdNwGt-UYQaiB1c/view?usp=sharing)  
  - Pre-split training/testing arrays:  
    - `x_train` (4800√ó8192), `y_train` (4800√ó41)  
    - `x_test`  (1200√ó8192), `y_test`  (1200√ó41)  

- **`Activity.csv`** (included in this repository)  
  - Corresponding activity labels: columns are radionuclide names (41 columns), rows align with `Spectra.csv`.

üëâ For convenience, a text file [`link_download.txt`](./data/link_download.txt) is also provided in the `data/` folder containing the same download links.

## ‚öõÔ∏è MCNP Input Decks

To ensure full reproducibility, we also provide the **MCNP input files** used to generate the dataset:

- **`Out0000`**  
  - Defines the HPGe detector and soil-container geometry.  
  - Material compositions (Ge, soil matrix, polystyrene, aluminum, copper, air).  
  - Photon source definitions (energies and branching ratios from NuDat 3.0 and Nucl√©ide-Lara).  
  - Tally settings (F8:P pulse-height tally, 8192 channels).  
  - Physics cards (photoelectric effect, Compton scattering, pair production; 10 keV cut-off).  
  - Explicit random-number seed.

These input decks allow researchers to regenerate spectra under the same simulation conditions or extend the setup to new scenarios.

## üîÑ Post-Processing Workflow

We provide a reproducible workflow to convert MCNP tally outputs into 8192-channel spectra:

1. **Collect output files**  
   - Use Python‚Äôs `glob` to list all MCNP outputs (`Out****o`) in the simulation folder.  
   - Store the file paths in a list (`PathList`).

2. **Initialize output**  
   - Create an output directory if not present.  
   - Open a file (e.g., `GMX_THo`) to store extracted spectra.

3. **Parse each MCNP output**  
   - Read the file line by line (`readlines()`).  
   - Locate the line containing `"cell  1"` (Ge detector crystal), typically between lines 1140‚Äì1500.  
   - From two lines below this marker, extract the **Tally-8 (F8:P) results**.

4. **Extract 8192 bins**  
   - Read the next 8192 lines, each representing one energy channel.  
   - Slice characters 16‚Äì28 to obtain the numeric count value.  
   - Append all 8192 values to the output file on a single line.

5. **Finalize**  
   - Close the input file, then proceed to the next output.  
   - After processing all files, the consolidated file (`GMX_THo`) will contain 6,000 rows √ó 8192 columns.  
   - Each row corresponds to one simulated gamma-ray spectrum.

üëâ No additional calibration or smoothing was applied: the spectra reflect raw MCNP pulse-height tallies mapped to 8192 channels.

## üöÄ Quickstart

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/haipn91/hpge-soil-gamma-41.git
cd hpge-soil-gamma-41


# Load the data in Python
import numpy as np

data = np.load('../data/hpge-soil-gamma-41.npz')
x_train, y_train = data['x_train'], data['y_train']
x_test,  y_test  = data['x_test'],  data['y_test']
```

## üìä Benchmarks
We include example notebooks under `examples/` to reproduce our baseline results:

- **Ridge Regression** and **XGBoost**: `examples/Machine_learning_regression.ipynb`  
- **MLP** and **CNN**: `examples/Neural_net_pytorch_regression.ipynb`

## üß™ Worked Example: Load Saved Model & Predict One Spectrum

Use the script below to load the saved scaler and Ridge model, select a random test sample, and predict activities for all 41 isotopes.

```bash
python examples/infer_one_sample.py
```

Ensure the following files exist (produced during training):
scaler/input_scaler.sav
models/ridge_multioutput_model.sav (or models/xgboost_multioutput_model.sav if you kept the original name)
